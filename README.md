# BATNXT
🏏 BatNXT – Smart Cricket Bat Technology

BatNXT is a next-generation smart cricket bat system designed to bridge the gap between amateur and professional play. The project integrates embedded sensors inside a cricket bat to capture real-time batting data and digitally replicate the behavior of professional match bats using software analysis.

The system measures key parameters such as bat swing, impact force, timing, angle, and vibration patterns. These values are processed using embedded systems and software models to provide accurate performance feedback to players, coaches, and analysts.

BatNXT aims to:

Replicate professional bat performance digitally

Help players improve technique through data-driven insights

Enable affordable training analytics without expensive equipment

Support talent development at grassroots and academy levels
